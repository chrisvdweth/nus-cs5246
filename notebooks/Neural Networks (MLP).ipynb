    "# Neural Networks (MLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most common neural network models used in the field of deep learning. Often referred to as a \"vanilla\" neural network, an MLP is simpler than the complex models of today's era (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). However, the techniques it introduced have paved the way for further advanced neural networks. An MLP consists of interconnected neurons (i.e., Logistic Regression units) transferring information to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MLP is a feedforward neural network, which means that the data is transmitted from the input layer to the output layer in the forward direction. All neurons of one layer are connected to all the neurons in the next layer. The connections between the layers are assigned weights. The weight of a connection specifies its importance. This concept is the backbone of an MLP's learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This notebook does not serve as a proper introductory tutorial into PyTorch, it only provides a minimal example for implementing a basic MLP text classifier, glossing over many details. If you are totally new to PyTorch, it's highly recommended to check out the tutorials on the [official PyTorch page](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)."

This means, any time we change the `max_features` parameter of the vectorizer, we define our model using the value. In this implementation, we use [`nn.ReLU`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html) (Rectified Linear Unit) as the activation function for each unit, which became often of the activation of choice. Still, fill free to try out other activation functions (e.g., [`nn.Tanh`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Tanh.html#torch.nn.Tanh)).\n",

This is very common in practice as it makes computation typically numerical stable as Softmax probabilities can be very small, particularly in case of many class labels. While we have only 2 classes here, and Softmax will probably do just fine, using the LogSoftmax is just a good practice. Of course, the outputs are no longer probabilities but log probabilities.
